Learning web design has taught me the importance of making things look clean and easy to use. I enjoy checking out new design trends to improve my skills. Designing is my way of expressing creativity and bringing ideas to life. I get inspiration from different websites and design pages. Making my own designs gives me a sense of pride and happiness. I believe a good design makes content more engaging and interesting. Since I know how to use Canva, HTML, and CSS, I can help with digital projects and branding.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>When I’m bored, I love playing Mobile Legends. It’s a fun and competitive game that helps me pass the time. I enjoy teaming up with friends and improving my skills. Winning matches makes me feel excited and motivated. The game also helps me think fast and make good decisions under pressure. I like trying different heroes and strategies to see what works best for me. Aside from gaming, I spend a lot of time scrolling through social media. Social media helps me stay updated on trends, news, and entertainment. Watching funny videos and memes always makes my day better. I also use social media to chat with friends and share posts. Sometimes, I follow influencers and content creators who post about gaming, tech, and lifestyle. Social media keeps me entertained, especially when I have nothing else to do. Aside from that, I also enjoy watching anime and TV series. I love action, adventure, and mystery genres because they keep me hooked. Binge-watching my favorite shows is one of my favorite ways to relax. I also like listening to music while browsing social media—it makes everything more fun. Music helps me focus and lifts my mood throughout the day. Sometimes, I also watch tutorials and educational videos to learn something new. I enjoy discovering new things and expanding my knowledge. Doing these hobbies makes my free time more fun and enjoyable.</p>

            <h3>Interest</h3>
            <p>I have a big interest in motor scooters, especially the ADV 160 and Aerox. I love their cool and stylish designs. The ADV 160 is built for adventure, and I like that it can handle different road conditions. It has a sporty and tough look that makes it stand out. The Aerox, on the other hand, has a sleek and modern design that I really admire. It’s fast and fuel-efficient, which makes it a great ride. I enjoy learning about different scooter models and their features. Watching YouTube reviews and vlogs helps me understand which scooter fits my style. I’m also interested in customizing scooters to improve their looks and performance. I think modifying a scooter is a great way to express personality and creativity. Sometimes, I visit motorcycle shops just to check out the latest models and accessories. Seeing well-maintained scooters on the road makes me excited to own one someday. I believe scooters are a fun and convenient way to travel. They make commuting easier, especially in traffic. Riding a scooter seems like a great experience that brings both excitement and freedom. I also love learning about how scooters work and the technology behind them. Their fuel efficiency and smooth ride make them perfect for daily use. I dream of owning a well-customized scooter that truly matches my personality. Learning about scooters has made me appreciate the motorcycling world even more. One day, I hope to travel to different places while riding my dream scooter.</p>
